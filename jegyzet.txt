Mandartory elements in a G4 simulation:
    1.) RunManager->calls YourDetectorConstruction::Build() -> i.e: builds the detector, we can define PhysicsLists, 
    2.) YourDetectorConstruction::Build() -> define the geometry and material of the detector
    3.) PhysicsLists
    4.) UserPrimaryGeneratorAction: defines how the partiles should be created in an event -> one event is produced after hitting the green button?
    5.) YourActionInitialization: with this we can register the UserPrimaryGeneratorAction with the RunManager


1.) YourDetectorConstruction
    -isotopes: G4Isotope
    -elements: G4Element: can be made up with more than one isotope (enriched uranium) ----> ::AddIsotope()
    -material: G4Material: can be cretd by giving it elements (and the number of them) ----> H20 (chemical molecule)
    -nistManager:: a database with 3000+ isotopes: mainly used if we don't want to specify its properties manually, and there is a wast number
    of gretly predefined materials: liquidArgon
    -solid-, logical-, phyisical volumes

    a.) Solid: G4VSolid->everything is dervied from here, gives access to multiple operations: distance calculations, logical check for points being
    inside/outside/on the surface of an object ----> G4Box, G4Tube, G4Para
    b.) Logical: we can give the material definition of an object
    c.) Physical: we can place inside the wolrd: G4PVPlacement()->check for overlaps, mother volume, index, rotation, translation

2.) YouPhysicsList:
    -this needs to be filled!

3.) UserInterface
    -we can give some commands: command /directory/name parameters ---> /run/beamOn 100
    -UI->ApplyCommand(â€œ/tracking/verbose 1"); ---> it is said to be slow, so it is advised to use these via macro files or from the UI
    - /control/execute vas.mac ---> executes the macro file
    - batch mode vs. interactive mode: if macro files are provided, the gui isn't needed to be shown!

4.) Visualisation:
    -G4VisManager---> it is used to visualise the things: mostly OpenGL + QT is used, it doesn't work fine on this machine......
